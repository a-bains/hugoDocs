The European Parliament has approved and adopted a new set of standards to improve data protection rights for individuals living in or visiting the European Union. This new set of standards, called the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), officially takes effect on May 25, 2018.

GDPR not only affects businesses operating in the EU, but also global companies that sell their products and services in the EU.

**Your company’s mobile business is a key component of GDPR, and the right mobile security strategy can have a big impact on your journey to GDPR compliance. Find out how SamsungKnox.com and partner Samsung B2B sites can help your business stay compliant with these new privacy laws.**
